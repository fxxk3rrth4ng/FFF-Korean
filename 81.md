모두 안녕하세요.

### 숫자로 나타낸 3년간의 팩토리오

팩토리오의 첫 커밋은 20212년 3월 31일 이루어졌고, 따라서 팩토리오는 3년하고도 11일째 개발중에 있습니다.

저희의 노력을 숫자로 나타내면:

-   1,106일동안 개발중
-   88번의 공개 릴리즈
-   master 브랜치에서의 14,082번의 커밋
-   204,917줄, 546,339개의 단어, 7,693,483 자, 약 책 15권 분량의 코드
-   비어있지 않은 54,114,147개의 픽셀로 이루어진 2,091개의 서로 다른 스프라이트
-   1,492개의 해결된 버그 (포럼에 제보된 버그만 계산함)
-   3,027줄의 패치노트

그리고 그 결과:

-   56,500개의 YouTube 영상
-   구글에서의 팩토리오 검색횟수 403,000회
-   서로 다른 873,509회의 [www.factorio.com](https://www.factorio.com) 방문횟수
-   75,146개의 포럼 게시글
-   그리고 마침내 74,914부의 판매량

이것은 구매자 1명당 코드 2.7줄, 하루에 12.7커밋, 아니면 스프라이트 한개당 YouTube 영상 2.7개 같은 비교를 보여주는데요, 하루종일도 할 수 있겠네요 :)

### 구체적인 연속 신호

We already told that our plan for 0.12 contains the chain signals, but it's the time now to explain the details. The chain signals have some similarities with the TTD pre signals, but as they actually work differently, we also decided to call them differently to avoid confusion.

In TTD, the signals play very different role in the train pathfinding logic, as they often tell trains where to go.
In Factorio, trains know exactly where to go, and signals are mainly just preventing them from crashing to each other or blocking each other. The only role the signals have in the path finding is, that whenever would the train have to stop because of the red signal, it tries to recalculate its path.

**The definition:** While normal signal prevents train from entering the occupied block, chain signal prevents train from entering the block also when the exit isn't free. When more exits exist, the one relevant to the train path is taken into account.

We don't have the graphics for chain signal ready yet, so I will use a signs to differentiate chain and regular signals.

**Regular signal:**

This is how the regular signal works, the block it guards is empty, so the train can go there:

**Simple example:**

Chain signal with one exit doesn't allow the train to enter the block, as the exit is occupied.

**Simple example with practical usage:**

The chain signal prevents the train from blocking the other route while waiting.

**Double crossing:**

Double crossings are the cause of train jams often, as trains tend to get blocked in the middle of the crossing. It can even cause total deadlock, which require manual intervention to fix the problem. With chain signals, the non-blocking rails are still separated, but trains won't stay in the middle of the crossing.

**Deadlock prevention:**

One of the typical situation with train deadlock problem is the usage of single train line for both direction with occasional bypasses. The example of the blocked situation with regular signals:

With chain signals, this problem can be totally avoided by preventing the train from going to the shared section unless it can exit it.

As you can see, the chain signals add a lot of possibilities to the train system coordination, mainly for larger and more crowded systems. The implementation of the chain signal is almost complete, just some bugs and automated tests of it have to be finished, so this will get to 0.12 for sure.
